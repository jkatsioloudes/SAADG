REPORT FOR DECRED DECENTRALISED GOVERNANCE ATTACK SIMULATOR<br><br>

While this is the case for on-chain votes that vote towards PoW block validity, this is not to be confused with off-chain votes for proposals and consensus rules which is our focus in this simulation. Luckily, the right to vote for governance proposals remains valid during the entirevoting window as long as tickets were part of the initial proposal quorum(contextually: snapshot of ticket pool at the time where the voting started).<br><br>The number of days required is because Decred blocks are solved every five minutes which equals 288 blocks per day, therefore 1,440 expired tickets per day able to be replaced by 20 biddable tickets per block that equals 5,760 tickets as candidates to replace those 1,440.<br><br>HYPOTHETICAL REALISATION<br><br>Decred coin price before attack initiation (£): 22.02<br>Estimated coin price after purchase (£): 22.02<br>Decred ticket price before attack initiaton (in DCR): 109.72<br>Estimated ticket price after purchase (in DCR): 109.72<br>Estimated total cost with inflation (£): 4832.098<br>Cost includes competent bidding with high transaction fees to increase chances of ticket bids being picked by miners and placed in ticket pool.<br><br>Coins in circulation after purchase: 9777712<br>From which coins frozen for tickets: 4464616<br>Therefore, coins remaining available to acquire: 5313096<br>Ticket pool size after purchase: 40693<br>From which malicious: 2 (0.00% of total tickets)<br><br>RETURN ON INVESTMENT<br><br>Money invested in this attack are not lost, just exchanged from GBP to Decred.<br>Daily Decred expected from ticket block reward: 0.38 (£8.37)<br>Monthly Decred expected from ticket block reward: 11.62 (£255.87)<br>Yearly Decred expected from ticket block reward: 139.74 (£3077.07)<br>Estimated profits should also take into consideration any potential increase in the highly volatile original coin price with which tickets were acquired.<br><br>SUMMARY<br><br>Number of tickets required for malicious majority: 24415<br>This will take this number of days to be realised: 1 DAY<br>Estimated total cost with inflation (£): 4832.098<br>Ticket pool size: 40693<br>From which malicious: 2 (0.00% of total tickets)<br><br>INSIGHTS: WHAT PROBLEMS CAN WE CAUSE RIGHT NOW?<br><br>(1) PREVENT HONEST PROPOSALS TO GO THROUGH<br><br>EXAMPLE<br><br>Downvote key consensus changes that would make the coin more scalable<br><br>DESIGN VULNERABILITY<br><br>Decred tries to be cencorship-free and fully guided from its community, therefore all decisions are respected and final, without asking anything.<br><br>SUCCESS LIKELIHOOD: HIGH<br><br>Since the dominant motivation of ticket owners is profit from PoS rewards and not the coin development, it was noticed that governance proposals do not attract more than half of pool size votes therefore there exists high voting abstention which makes this attack very possible to happen.<br><br>METHODOLOGY<br><br>By down-voting proposals so that 60% margin is not achieved<br><br>EXPLOITATION<br><br>Total votes from malicious tickets: 2<br>Least honest votes required for net majority: 24415 (60% of ticket pool)<br>While ticket pool has a size of: 40691<br><br>(2) MALICIOUS PROPOSAL PASSES BY NEGLIGENCE<br><br>EXAMPLE<br><br>Malicious proposal up-voted from malicious tickets that had net majority prior to the start of voting window or even if they had not they can still dominate when voting abstention is high as it is in 99 out of 100 cases.<br><br>DESIGN VULNERABILITY<br><br>Votes are never questioned therefore if a proposal is accepted, no censorship exists.<br><br>SUCCESS LIKELIHOOD: MEDIUM<br><br>The controversy of a malicious proposal is expected to unite honest owners.<br><br>METHODOLOGY<br><br>Malicious proposal starts to be up-voted as close as possible to the closing window.<br><br>EXPLOITATION<br><br>Total votes from malicious tickets: 2<br>Which does not satisfy the minimum total vote requirements of 10% pool size:4070While ticket pool has a size of: 40691<br>
