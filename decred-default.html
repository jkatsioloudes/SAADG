While this is the case for on-chain votes that vote towards PoW block validity, this is not to be confused with off-chain votes for proposals and consensus rules which is our focus in this simulation. Luckily, the right to vote for governance proposals remains valid during the entire voting window as long as tickets were part of the initial proposal quorum (contextually: snapshot of ticket pool at the time where the voting started.<br><br>The number of days required is because Decred blocks are solved every five minutes which equals 288 blocks per day, therefore 1,440 expired tickets per day able to be replaced by 20 biddable tickets per block that equals 5,760 tickets as candidates to replace those 1,440<br><br>HYPOTHETICAL REALISATION<br><br>Decred coin price before attack initiation (£): 19.02<br>Estimated coin price after purchase (£): 41.26<br>Decred ticket price before attack initiaton (£): 141.7853124707183<br>Estimated ticket price after purchase (£): 119.55<br>Estimated total cost with inflation (£): 296470140.659<br><br>Coins in circulation after purchase: 9717835<br>From which coins frozen for tickets: 8386922<br>Therefore, coins remaining available to acquire: 1330913<br>These are enough to acquire more tickets, specifically: 0<br>However, the same constraints for ticket supply hold here too<br>Ticket pool size after purchase: 40960<br>From which malicious: 24593 (60.0% of total tickets)<br><br>SUMMARY<br><br>Number of tickets required for malicious majority: 24593<br>This will take this number of days to be realised: 17 DAYS<br>Estimated total cost with inflation (£): 296470140.659<br>Ticket pool size after purchase: 40960<br>From which malicious: 24593 (60.0% of total tickets)<br><br>INSIGHTS: WHAT PROBLEMS CAN WE CAUSE RIGHT NOW?<br><br>(1) PREVENT HONEST PROPOSALS TO GO THROUGH<br><br>EXAMPLE<br><br>Monthly salary of Dash Core Developers or other beneficial investments<br><br>DESIGN VULNERABILITY<br><br>Proposals are not partially funded and remaining governance funds are burnt.<br>Therefore, if attacked proposal is not in top rankings, it will be rejected.<br><br>SUCCESS LIKELIHOOD: HIGH<br><br>Because even if net 10% is achieved there is no funding guarantee.<br>Funding is granted to the top X proposals based on net percentage.<br><br>METHODOLOGY<br><br>By down-voting proposals so that the net 10% margin is not achieved<br><br>EXPLOITATION<br><br>Total votes of malicious masternodes: 24593<br>Least honest votes required for net majority: 27054<br>Maximum malicious masternodes based on available circulation: 40960<br>Least honest votes required for net majority: 45057<br><br>(2) MALICIOUS PROPOSAL PASSES BY NEGLIGENCE<br><br>EXAMPLE<br><br>Malicious proposal up-voted from malicious masternodes and abstention is high<br><br>DESIGN VULNERABILITY<br><br>Votes are never questioned therefore if a proposal is accepted, no censorship exists<br><br>SUCCESS LIKELIHOOD: MEDIUM<br><br>The controversy of a malicious proposal is expected to unite honest owners<br><br>METHODOLOGY<br><br>Malicious proposal starts to be up-voted as close as possible to the closing window<br><br>EXPLOITATION<br><br>Total votes of malicious masternodes: 24593<br>Least honest votes required for rejection: 22356<br>Maximum malicious masternodes based on available circulation: 40960<br>Least votes required for net majority against maximum malicious: 37235<br><br>HISTORIC DATA<br><br>Maximum votes ever recorded for funding a proposal is: 2147<br>At the time, this as percentage towards total masternodes was: 44.44%<br>Assuming a higher percentage this time due to unity from controversy: 60%<br>Which equals this number of honest masternodes: 9821<br>Therefore, total malicious masternodes needed for net majority: 10805<br><br>INFORMATION FOR THE FUTURE<br><br>Percentage of current circulation against total ever: 46.2%<br>Total ever coin supply: 21000000<br>Remaining ever coin supply: 11282165<br>Corresponding masternodes: 11282<br><br>EXPECTED CIRCULATION PER YEAR<br><br>09/2020: 9486800 (50.14% of total ever)<br>Available masternodes: -232<br><br>09/2021:10160671 (53.7% of total ever)<br>Available masternodes: 442<br><br>08/2029 (74.41%), 03/2043 (90.23%), 05/2073 (98.86%), 04/2150 (100%)<br><br>
