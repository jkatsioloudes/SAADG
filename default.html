4842<br>Masternodes required for net 10% over honest: 5328<br>Attack budget (£): cost of realise target of 5328 masternodes<br>Therefore, target total masternodes: 5328<br>Excluding those already

44.8%<br><br>ATTACK PHASE TWO: EXECUTION<br><br>FIRST PURCHASE ATTEMPT FOR 5328 MASTERNODES<br><br>PURCHASE OUTCOME: IMPOSSIBLE<br><br>REASON<br><br>Because the remaining coins in circulation are not enough for 5328 masternodes but for a maximum of 3936, still capable for an effective cyber sabotage<br><br>HYPOTHETICAL REALISATION<br><br>Dash price before attack initiation (£): 85.47<br>Estimated

WHAT PROBLEMS CAN WE CAUSE RIGHT NOW?<br><br>(1) PREVENT HONEST PROPOSALS TO GO THROUGH<br><br>EXAMPLE<br><br>Monthly salary of Dash Core Developers or other beneficial investments<br><br>DESIGN VULNERABILITY<br><br>Proposals are not partially funded and remaining governance funds are burnt.<br>Therefore, if attacked proposal is not in top rankings, it will be rejected.<br><br>SUCCESS LIKELIHOOD: HIGH<br><br>Because even if net 10% is achieved there is no funding guarantee.<br>Funding is granted to the top X proposals based on net percentage.<br><br>METHODOLOGY<br><br>By down-voting proposals so that the net 10% margin is not achieved<br><br>EXPLOITATION<br><br>Maximum malicious masternodes based on available circulation: 3936<br>Least honest votes required for net majority: 4331<br><br>(2) MALICIOUS PROPOSAL PASSES BY NEGLIGENCE<br><br>EXAMPLE<br><br>Malicious proposal up-voted from malicious masternodes and abstention is high<br><br>DESIGN VULNERABILITY<br><br>Votes are never questioned therefore if a proposal is accepted, no censorship exists<br><br>SUCCESS LIKELIHOOD: MEDIUM<br><br>The controversy of a malicious proposal is expected to unite honest owners<br><br>METHODOLOGY<br><br>Malicious proposal starts to be up-voted as close as possible to the closing window<br><br>EXPLOITATION<br><br>Maximum malicious masternodes based on available circulation: 3936<br>Least votes required for net majority against maximum malicious: 3577<br><br>HISTORIC DATA<br><br>Maximum votes ever recorded for funding a proposal is: 2147<br>At the time, this as percentage towards total masternodes was: 44.44%<br>Assuming a higher percentage this time due to unity from controversy: 60%<br>Which equals this number of honest masternodes: 2906<br>Therefore, total malicious masternodes needed for net majority: 3198<br><br>INFORMATION FOR THE FUTURE<br><br>Percentage of current circulation against total ever: 46.4%<br>Total ever coin
