REPORT FOR DASH DECENTRALISED GOVERNANCE ATTACK SIMULATOR<br><br>
FILES TO BE GENERATED<br><br>default.csv, default.html, default.pdf<br><br>VALUES PROCEEDING WITH<br><br>Attack budget (£): 700000000.0 (user defined value)<br>Dash price (£): 84.22 (real time value)<br>Inflation rate: 2.26 (default exponential)<br>Coins in circulation: 8775963 (real time value)<br>Total of honest masternodes: 4500 (user defined value)<br>Honest masternodes already under control or bribe: 0<br>Target total masternodes: 8311 (capped due to budget)<br><br>ATTACK PHASE ONE: PRE-PURCHASE ANALYSIS<br><br>Active masternodes before purchase: 4500<br>Masternodes required for net 10% over honest: 4951<br>Attack budget (£): 700000000.0 (enough to acquire 8311 masternodes)<br>Therefore, target total masternodes: 4951<br>Excluding those already under control or bribe, total: 0<br>Finalised total of masternodes to acquire: 4951<br><br>Coins in circulation before purchase: 8775963<br>From which coins frozen for required collateral: 4500000<br>Therefore, coins remaining available to acquire: 4275963<br>These are enough for this number of masternodes: 4275<br>Which as percentage out of the total possible masternodes is: 48.7%<br><br>ATTACK PHASE TWO: EXECUTION<br><br>FIRST PURCHASE ATTEMPT FOR 4951 MASTERNODES<br><br>PURCHASE OUTCOME: IMPOSSIBLE<br><br>REASON<br><br>Because the remaining coins in circulation are not enough for 4951 masternodes but for a maximum of 4275, still capable for an effective cyber sabotage<br><br>HYPOTHETICAL REALISATION<br><br>Dash price before attack initiation (£): 84.22<br>Estimated Dash price after purchase (£): 103.01<br>Estimated total cost with inflation (£): 699952457.571<br>Therefore remaining budget equals (£): 47542.429<br><br>Coins in circulation after purchase: 8775963<br>From which coins frozen for required collateral: 9451000  <---  (Problematic metric)<br>Therefore, coins remaining available to acquire: -675037  <---  (Problematic metric)<br>Theoretical total active masternodes after purchase: 9451<br>From which malicious: 4951 (52.3% of total masternodes)<br><br>SUMMARY<br><br>Number of masternodes required for malicious majority: 4951<br>The available coin supply was enough to buy this amount of masternodes: 4275<br>The attempted purchase was for: 4951 masternodes  <---  (Problematic metric)<br><br>SECOND PURCHASE ATTEMPT FOR 4275 MASTER NODES<br><br>PURCHASE OUTCOME POSSIBLE<br><br>ANALYSIS<br><br>Dash price before attack initiation (£): 84.22<br>Estimated Dash price after purchase (£): 93.88<br>Estimated total cost with inflation (£): 380694961.504<br><br>Coins in circulation after purchase: 8775963<br>From which coins frozen for required collateral: 8775000<br>Therefore, coins remaining available to acquire: 963<br>Total active masternodes after purchase: 8775<br>From which malicious: 4275 (48.7% of total masternodes)<br><br>SUMMARY<br><br>Number of masternodes required for malicious majority: 4951<br>Available supply was enough for this amount of

WHAT PROBLEMS CAN WE CAUSE RIGHT NOW?<br><br>(1) PREVENT HONEST PROPOSALS TO GO THROUGH<br><br>EXAMPLE<br><br>Monthly salary of Dash Core Developers or other beneficial investments<br><br>DESIGN VULNERABILITY<br><br>Proposals are not partially funded and remaining governance funds are burnt.<br>Therefore, if attacked proposal is not in top rankings, it will be rejected.<br><br>SUCCESS LIKELIHOOD: HIGH<br><br>Because even if net 10% is achieved there is no funding guarantee.<br>Funding is granted to the top X proposals based on net percentage.<br><br>METHODOLOGY<br><br>By down-voting proposals so that the net 10% margin is not achieved<br><br>EXPLOITATION<br><br>Maximum malicious masternodes based on available circulation: 4275<br>Least honest votes required for net majority: 4704<br><br>(2) MALICIOUS PROPOSAL PASSES BY NEGLIGENCE<br><br>EXAMPLE<br><br>Malicious proposal up-voted from malicious masternodes and abstention is high<br><br>DESIGN VULNERABILITY<br><br>Votes are never questioned therefore if a proposal is accepted, no censorship exists<br><br>SUCCESS LIKELIHOOD: MEDIUM<br><br>The controversy of a malicious proposal is expected to unite honest owners<br><br>METHODOLOGY<br><br>Malicious proposal starts to be up-voted as close as possible to the closing window<br><br>EXPLOITATION<br><br>Maximum malicious masternodes based on available circulation: 4275<br>Least votes required for net majority against maximum malicious: 3885<br><br>HISTORIC DATA<br><br>Maximum votes ever recorded for funding a proposal is: 2147<br>At the time, this as percentage towards total masternodes was: 44.44%<br>Assuming a higher percentage this time due to unity from controversy: 60%<br>Which equals this number of honest masternodes: 2700<br>Therefore, total malicious masternodes needed for net majority: 2972<br><br>INFORMATION FOR THE FUTURE<br><br>Percentage of current circulation against total ever: 46.4%<br>Total ever coin supply: 18900000<br>Remaining ever coin supply: 10124037<br>Corresponding masternodes: 10124<br><br>EXPECTED CIRCULATION PER YEAR<br><br>09/2020: 9486800 (50.14% of total ever)<br>Available masternodes: 710<br><br>09/2021:10160671 (53.7% of total ever)<br>Available masternodes: 1384<br><br>08/2029 (74.41%), 03/2043 (90.23%), 05/2073 (98.86%), 04/2150 (100%)<br><br>
